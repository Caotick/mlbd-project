# CS-421 Project

This is the repository of the project for the CS-421 course.

In order to replicate our experiments, you need:

* The last-fm360k dataset which is downloadble [here](http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html).
* The  'full_spotify_info.csv' file which was obtained using the Spotify API. The file is already provided in the data folder of the repo.
* The groups that were generated using the create_groups notebook. The groups used to assess the methods are already in the data folder.


To replicate our experiments, you can just run the cells of the mlbd-project notebook in order.
